## Contributing to Meetings

### Prepare Content
 - Well ahead of the MFWG plenary meeting, produce and publish documentation about your proposal/idea, slides, design document, Github issue or any other relevant material, to be shared beforehand and presented during the meeting.

### Getting on the agenda
To propose a presentation/ time slot in MFWG plenary meetings:

- Add a comment on the upcoming meeting [Agenda Github Issue Example](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/issues/207)
    > Include all relevant information about the topic including necessary documentation.
    
- If you intend to have a consensus or voting during your presentation, prepare questions in advance and share them along with the rest of the information.


**Important:**  Agenda items are triaged and shared with the group the week before the plenary, please make sure you submit your proposal on time, so that can be included for the next meeting agenda.
